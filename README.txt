# libmyfloat
Library for floating point numbers

It uses "float" as its datatype for numerical operations.

Using "float" can be faster than "double", but is less accurate.


On x86_64 and compatible computers:

Single floating-point registers uses 32 bits.
Double floating-point registers uses 64 bits.

All floating-point calculations on these systems use the floating point co-processor.

Notice the difference between "float" and "double":
